# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Event Handler Microservice
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the central event handler microservice that manages event publishing, subscription, and logging across all microservices.
# Details:
1. Create a new FastAPI service inheriting from the base microservice
2. Implement WebSocket support for real-time event streaming
3. Build event publishing endpoint that validates and logs events
4. Create subscription management system for services to register interest in event types
5. Implement event persistence and retrieval API
6. Add detailed logging of all event activities
7. Create README.md with usage documentation

# Test Strategy:
Test event publishing with various event types, test subscription management, verify events are properly logged, test WebSocket connections maintain state correctly, and ensure events are delivered to all subscribed services.
