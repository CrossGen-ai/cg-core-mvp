# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the authentication system for user validation and secure N8N integration with API keys.
# Details:
1. Create authentication microservice inheriting from base microservice
2. Implement user registration and login endpoints
3. Build JWT token generation and validation
4. Create secure API key management for N8N integration
5. Implement user validation middleware that can be used by all services
6. Add role-based access control
7. Create password reset and account management functionality
8. Document security practices in README.md

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration and login flows, verify JWT token generation and validation, test API key security for N8N, ensure user validation middleware correctly identifies authenticated users, and test role-based access control.
