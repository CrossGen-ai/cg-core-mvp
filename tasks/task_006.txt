# Task ID: 6
# Title: Set Up Docker Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create Docker configuration for development and deployment of all microservices and the frontend.
# Details:
1. Create individual Dockerfiles for each microservice
2. Create a Dockerfile for the Next.js frontend
3. Set up docker-compose.yml for local development
4. Configure environment variable passing to containers
5. Set up volume mapping for development
6. Create production-ready Docker configurations
7. Document Docker usage in README.md
8. Ensure services can also run without Docker for local development

# Test Strategy:
Test building and running each container individually, test the complete system with docker-compose, verify environment variables are correctly passed to containers, and ensure volumes are properly mapped for development.
