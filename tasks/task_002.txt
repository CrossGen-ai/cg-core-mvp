# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Base FastAPI Microservice Class
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a base class for all microservices that includes user validation, error/event logging, MCP protocol implementation, and plugin/feature flag support.
# Details:
1. Create a `base_microservice.py` class that all services will inherit from
2. Implement user validation middleware
3. Add error and event logging functionality
4. Create the MCP (standard protocol) for API responses and events
5. Build plugin architecture with feature flag support
6. Include comprehensive docstrings and comments
7. Set up configuration from environment variables

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each component of the base class: test user validation with mock users, test error logging captures exceptions properly, test MCP protocol formatting, and test plugin loading/feature flag functionality.
